# devsCPP

__devsCPP__ is a DEVS C++ library for the Discrete Event System Specification.
The framework features:
* Functionality for distributing the simulation across multiple processes or computers.
* Support to add or remove remote models at runtime.
* Interfaces to interact with external software (software-in-the-loop) or hardward (hardware-in-the-loop).
* Facilities to run the simulation: step by step, as fast as possible and in real time.
* A simple user interface that allows basic control of the simulation.

The library was initially developed as part of [DEVS-TOSSIM](https://github.com/rgmarelli/devs-tossim).
