<h1>DEVS-TOSSIM: A DEVS framework for simulation of TinyOS wireless sensor networks</h1>

<p><strong>DEVS-TOSSIM</strong> is a simulation framework, which implements the <em>DEVS formalism</em>, to test and simulate wireless sensor networks that use the <em>TinyOS</em> operating system. </p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Heterogeneous wireless sensor networks</strong>: DEVS-TOSSIM can simulate heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, which implies that in the same simulation can coexist nodes that run different software and hardware.</li>
  <li><strong>Duty-cycling</strong>: the transceiver model supports duty cycling.</li>
  <li><strong>User interface</strong>: simple user interface to control the simulation; the interface allows the user to control time during the simulation, for example: execute the simulation in real-time, as fast as possible or step-by-step.</li>
  <li><strong>Integration with external systems</strong>: functionality is provided to integrate the simulator with external hardware or software systems.</li>
  <li><strong>Extensible framework</strong>: the framework allows the replacement of the sensor component of a node, the addition of mobility, the implementation of a new radio model or modeling a complex sensing environment.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The history behind of DEVS-TOSSIM</h2>

<p>DEVS-TOSSIM software is the implementation of my degree thesis in computer engineering at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fi.uba.ar/">school of engineering of the University of Buenos Aires</a>.</p>
